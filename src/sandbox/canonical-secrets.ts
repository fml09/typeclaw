// SECURITY / classification: operator-provisioned CLI credential stores. TypeClaw
// writes these through its own init/auth flows and points the matching CLI at them
// (`dockerfile.ts` bakes `ENV AGENT_MESSENGER_CONFIG_DIR`), so the agent is MEANT
// to read them — the bundled `agent-*` and gws skills shell out to CLIs that
// resolve exactly these files. Masking them at every role does not withhold a
// secret, it breaks the skill and leaves the CLI reporting its own "not
// authenticated", which a model relays as a fact about the upstream service.
//
// So they take the ordinary private-surface role gate, which is what applied to
// them before they were named here (they live under `workspace/`). Add a path
// here only if a shipped skill needs to read it; anything that must stay hidden
// from every role belongs in `secrets.json`, not in a masked directory.
